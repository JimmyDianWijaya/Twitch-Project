# Twitch-Project

This project was a collaboration with the Twitch Data Science team. 
I support the team through the exploratory analysis stage to understand the company's users and products. 
This project was conducted with SQL in MySQL platform. 

There are two tables involved in this project:
1. chat table
2. stream table

The questions we were trying to answer:
1. What are the most popular games based on our stream table? 
2. Given that League of Legends is the most popular game based on our data, where are these LoL stream viewers located at? 
3. What are the players the viewers using? 
4. The number of view count every hour in the US. What's the busiest hour ?

I also provided data visualisations on question number 1, 2 and 4 using Python Matplotlib. 

Feel free to download these files for a sneak peek how I approached this project

Kind Regards,
